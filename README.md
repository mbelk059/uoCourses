# ‚ú® Features
* **Course Search:** Find courses by describing your career goals, academic interests, or specific subjects
(e.g., "I want to improve at data structures," "How do I become a doctor?" or "I want skills to become a CEO").
* **AI-Powered Responses:** Recommendations are presented using Gemini AI.
* **Comprehensive Course Data:** Pulls detailed information on course codes, titles, descriptions, and prerequisites from the uoapi.
* **User-Friendly API:** Simple /chat endpoint to interact with the system.
  
# üöÄ How It Works
1. **Input Query:** Users describe their interests or goals (e.g., "_I want to study robotics_").
2.  **Smart Filtering:** The system uses a score-based algorithm to match courses:
    * Assigns higher scores to subject code matches
    * Prioritizes keywords in course titles over descriptions
    * Considers course level preferences (beginner, advanced, graduate)
3. **AI Enhancement:** Top-ranked courses are sent to Gemini AI for natural language recommendations
4. **Response Validation:** System verifies AI output contains valid course codes and falls back to simple listing if needed
